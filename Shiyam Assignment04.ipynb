The objective of the game is to score more runs than your opponent. There are three variations of the game (Test, One Day, and Twenty-20). Cricket is followed by millions of fans around the world. The human asks which team won the first world cup. The AI says The first Cricket World Cup was played in 1975. The West Indies team won the tournament by defeating Australia in the final. The current winners of the Cricket World Cup are England. They defeated New Zealand in the finals to win the tournament. The Ashes is a Test cricket series played between England and Australia. The series is played every two years, with each team hosting the series every other year. The series is currently tied, with both teams having won three times.\n","Human: Who is called as Cricket Legend\n","AI:\u001b[0m\n","\n","\u001b[1m> Finished chain.\u001b[0m\n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["' Many people are called Cricket Legends.
